## OSS activity

![@icflorescu on GitHub](https://github-profile-trophy.vercel.app/?username=icflorescu&column=4&row=4&theme=nord)  

## Current tech-stack

- **Typescript/JavaScript**
- **Node.js**
- **React, Next.js, Remix/ReactRouter, Tanstack Router**, but I'm also **interested in Svelte/SvelteKit**
- **React UI Frameworks** I've been working with:
  - **[Mantine](https://mantine.dev) — I'm a contributor and also the author of 📒 [Mantine DataTable](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-datatable/) and 🖱️ [Mantine ContextMenu](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-contextmenu/)**
  - **[Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/overview/)**
  - **[MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)**
  - **[Blueprint.js](https://blueprintjs.com/)**
- **[tRPC](https://trpc.io) — I'm a contributor and the creator of ✨ [tRPC-SvelteKit](https://icflorescu.github.io/trpc-sveltekit)** and ✨ **[tRPC-Transformer](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-transformer)**
- **[Valtio](https://valtio.dev/docs/introduction/getting-started)** & [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) — I favor modern state-management solutions over plain Redux
- **PostgreSQL, [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)**/[ZenStack](https://zenstack.dev/), [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/), [DrizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/), [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)
- SQL in general; I have designed enterprise SQLServer/Oracle DB architectures while working for multinational companies in the past  
- Worked with **[NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)**, but I'm also interested in [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/)
- [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) — I'm a fan of the lightest "back-end in one file" solution and **the creator of 📦 [PocketBaseUML](https://pocketbase-uml.github.io/)**
- **Firebase** (mostly firebase-auth)
- I have a few CSS tricks up my sleeve, a good understanding of the DOM, I'm fluent with CSS-in-JS, SASS/CSS-Modules, PostCSS, Emotion and I'm even good-enough at creating website/application designs *from scratch*; here are some examples:
  - The docs websites for [Mantine DataTable](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-datatable/), [Mantine ContextMenu](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-contextmenu/), [tRPC-SvelteKit](https://icflorescu.github.io/trpc-sveltekit/) and [ASPAX](https://aspax.github.io)
  - [yadda.ro](https://yadda.ro), [swapp.ro](https://swapp.ro), [boutiquetravel.ro](https://boutiquetravel.ro/), [interiordelight™️](https://interiordelight.github.io/), [King's Host](https://kingshost.github.io/), [AJM Fleet Purchase](https://ajm-fleetpurchase.com/), [sellcarbuycar.com](https://sellcarbuycar.com/), [LeasingSH.ro](https://www.leasingsh.ro/), [PocketBaseUML](https://pocketbase-uml.github.io/)
 
Not a huge fan of Tailwind, but I cope with it well enough to be currently developing my own practical, opinionated component library based on shadcn/ui.

## Things I've worked with, back in the Dark Ages

- PHP & MySQL, around y2k (yeah, I'vew been around a while)
- Java/J2EE, .NET/C#, Oracle, SQL Server, BizTalk, cca. 2002—2007
- CoffeeScript & IcedCofeeScript, back when when JS had no async/await
- Quite a few templating languages such as [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) or [Jade/Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and some strange old JS frameworks ([Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/), [Riot.js](https://riot.js.org/)) in the pre-React era

## Notable open-source projects I've built over the years
- 📒 [Mantine DataTable](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-datatable/) — a "dark-theme aware" table component for your Mantine UI data-rich applications, featuring asynchronous data loading support, pagination, multiple rows selection, column sorting, custom cell data rendering, row context menu, and more
- 🖱️ [Mantine ContextMenu](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-contextmenu/) — A lightweight yet customizable context-menu for your Mantine applications, with a succinct API and dark-theme support
- 🛠️ [Mantine Start](https://github.com/icflorescu/mantine-start) and [Mantine Next](https://github.com/icflorescu/mantine-next) — Starter templates for Mantine and TanStack Start / Next.js applications
- ✨ [tRPC-SvelteKit](https://icflorescu.github.io/trpc-sveltekit) — an adapter allowing you to build end-to-end typesafe APIs with tRPC.io in your SvelteKit applications
- ✨ [tRPC-Transformer](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-transformer) — A simple tRPC transformer based on superjson with Decimal.js support
- 📦 [PocketBaseUML](https://pocketbase-uml.github.io/) — a free, open-source UML diagram generator for PocketBase that can be used online to connect to HTTPS servers, or runned as an `npm` package to inspect local HTTP servers
- 🐧 [Expose-WSL](https://github.com/icflorescu/expose-wsl) — probably the easiest way to expose apps running on WSL to local network devices
- 🌐 [IISExpress-Proxy](https://github.com/icflorescu/iisexpress-proxy) — A simple, yet practical command-line utility enabling .NET developers to test web applications served by IIS Express on remote devices; it's been around since 2015, but *I'm amazed by the sheer number of people who still have to use **IISExpress** nowadays*
- 📖 [textdiff-create](https://github.com/icflorescu/textdiff-create) and [textdiff-patch](https://github.com/icflorescu/textdiff-patch) — simple utilities for [creating and applying lean text diffs](https://medium.com/@icflorescu/lean-diffs-for-browser-based-text-editors-46e363bc6dfe)
- 🛠️ [ASPAX](https://aspax.github.io/) — a simple **Node.js asset packager** inspired by Rails, in 2013, when Webpack didn't exist
- ⚙️ [Node.js](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-nodejs), [MongoDB](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-mongodb), [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-postgresql) & [MySQL](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-mysql) cartridges for **Redhat's OpenShift**, in 2014-2015, when Docker wasn't yet a wide-spread tool

> [!IMPORTANT]

> Dedicating time to build and maintain great open-source projects would not be possible without your generosity.  

## The long(er) story

You can find my boring, full-length ~~obituary~~ LinkedIn profile at [linkedin.com/in/icflorescu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/), but here's the blurb:
- 25+ years of experience in web and software development
- I've worked for various companies (from mid-sized to large multinationals such as [Allianz](https://www.allianztiriac.ro/) and Garanta — [member of National Bank of Greece](https://www.nbg.gr/en/group)) during the initial part of my career; for the last part I've been working as an independent developer
- I sometimes ~~rant~~ write about technology and its impact on human behaviour in [articles like these](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/recent-activity/posts/).

## Hobbies, likes & dislikes

❤️ open-source, lazy mornings, good coffee, trekking in the mountains, reading  
👎 hypocrisy, xenophobia, willful ignorance, people talking bullshit  

## Before approaching me for work

I'm potentially interested in subcontracting front-end or full-stack development work (leaning towards front-end). Also interested in sweat-equity partnerships.    

You can learn more about what I did over the years by visiting my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/), but since you are on this page, chances are that you already have a pretty good idea of how my skills could be of assistance.  
If you want to hire me, please consider that I'm most productive with [the aforementioned tech-stack](#current-tech-stack).  

> [!NOTE]
> I'm currently getting a constant flow of approaches, some of them relevant, others not so relevant[^2]. Therefore, mentioning in your text that *you've seen my GitHub profile* would:
> - tell me that you know exactly what you need me for (as opposed to just trying to fill a vacant role);
> - let me know that my skills would indeed be valuable for you and would spare us both valuable time that we'd otherwise have to spend in trying to assess that;
> - help me **prioritize your message** and come up with a quick reply.

## How to approach me

Drop me a message at the email address listed in my GitHub profile and we'll schedule a meeting on [cal.com/icflorescu](https://cal.com/icflorescu).

[^1]: I couldn't find the time and motivation to turn [swapp.ro](https://swapp.ro/) into a real business and since the Romanian Government digital strategy related to eFactura is a major clusterduck, I've decided to stop aceepting new subscriptions.

[^2]: I'm not really a fan of multistage recruitment processes and taking coding tests.  
      My open-source projects are being starred and used by lots of developers and companies worldwide, sum up millions of NPM downloads and my coding skills are, therefore, vetted by the community.  
      If you want my help, we will be discussing about project specifics such as its value proposition and how can I contribute to "make it happen", challenges and how to overcome those, risks versus rewards.
