A full-stack developer from Bucharest, Romania, EU, with 20+ years of experience.  
Curious by nature, an avid reader of fantasy, fiction, history & tech-related literature, always looking to expand my skillset and horizons, to understand how things work and to make them work better.

## Current tech-stack

- **Typescript/JavaScript**
- **Node.js**
- **React/Next.js/Remix**, but I'm also **interested in Svelte/SvelteKit**
- **React UI Frameworks** I've been working with:
  - **[Mantine](https://mantine.dev) — I'm a contributor and also the author of 📒 [Mantine DataTable](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-datatable/) and 🖱️ [Mantine ContextMenu](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-contextmenu/)**
  - **[Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/overview/)**
  - **[MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)**
  - **[Blueprint.js](https://blueprintjs.com/)**
- **[tRPC](https://trpc.io) — I'm a contributor and the creator of ✨ [tRPC-SvelteKit](https://icflorescu.github.io/trpc-sveltekit)** and ✨ **[tRPC-Transformer](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-transformer)**
- **PostgreSQL, [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)**, [Hasura](https://hasura.io/), [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/), [DrizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/)

- Worked with **[NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)**, but I'm also interested in [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/)
- [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) — I'm a fan of the lightest "back-end in one file" solution and **the creator of 📦 [PocketBaseUML](https://pocketbase-uml.github.io/)**
- **Firebase** (mostly firebase-auth)
- I have a few CSS tricks up my sleeve, a good understanding of the DOM, I'm fluent with CSS-in-JS, SASS/CSS-Modules, PostCSS, Emotion and I'm even good-enough at creating website/application designs *from scratch*; here are some examples:
  - The docs websites for [Mantine DataTable](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-datatable/), [Mantine ContextMenu](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-contextmenu/), [tRPC-SvelteKit](https://icflorescu.github.io/trpc-sveltekit/) and [ASPAX](https://aspax.github.io)

Not a huge Tailwind fan.

## Things I've worked with, back in the Dark Ages

- PHP & MySQL, around y2k (yeah, I'm that old)
- Java/J2EE, .NET/C#, Oracle, SQL Server, BizTalk, cca. 2002—2007
- CoffeeScript & IcedCofeeScript, back when when JS had no async/await
- Quite a few templating languages such as [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) or [Jade/Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and some strange old JS frameworks ([Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/), [Riot.js](https://riot.js.org/)) in the pre-React era

## Notable open-source projects I've built over the years
Please consider [sponsoring my work](https://github.com/sponsors/icflorescu) if you find it useful.  
Dedicating time to build and maintain great open-source projects would not be possible without your generosity.  

- 📒 [Mantine DataTable](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-datatable/) — a "dark-theme aware" table component for your Mantine UI data-rich applications, featuring asynchronous data loading support, pagination, multiple rows selection, column sorting, custom cell data rendering, row context menu, and more
- 🖱️ [Mantine ContextMenu](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-contextmenu/) — A lightweight yet customizable context-menu for your Mantine applications, with a succinct API and dark-theme support
- ✨ [tRPC-SvelteKit](https://icflorescu.github.io/trpc-sveltekit) — an adapter allowing you to build end-to-end typesafe APIs with tRPC.io in your SvelteKit applications
- ✨ [tRPC-Transformer](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-transformer) — A simple tRPC transformer based on superjson with Decimal.js support
- 📦 [PocketBaseUML](https://pocketbase-uml.github.io/) — a free, open-source UML diagram generator for PocketBase that can be used online to connect to HTTPS servers, or runned as an `npm` package to inspect local HTTP servers
- 🐧 [Expose-WSL](https://github.com/icflorescu/expose-wsl) — probably the easiest way to expose apps running on WSL to local network devices
- 🌐 [IISExpress-Proxy](https://github.com/icflorescu/iisexpress-proxy) — A simple, yet practical command-line utility enabling .NET developers to test web applications served by IIS Express on remote devices; it's been around since 2015, but *I'm amazed by the sheer number of people who still have to use **IISExpress** nowadays*
- 📖 [textdiff-create](https://github.com/icflorescu/textdiff-create) and [textdiff-patch](https://github.com/icflorescu/textdiff-patch) — simple utilities for [creating and applying lean text diffs](https://medium.com/@icflorescu/lean-diffs-for-browser-based-text-editors-46e363bc6dfe)
- 🛠️ [ASPAX](https://aspax.github.io/) — a simple **Node.js asset packager** inspired by Rails, in 2013, when Webpack didn't exist
- ⚙️ [Node.js](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-nodejs), [MongoDB](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-mongodb), [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-postgresql) & [MySQL](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-mysql) cartridges for **Redhat's OpenShift**, in 2014-2015, when Docker wasn't yet a wide-spread tool

## The long(er) story

You can find my full-length boring ~~obituary~~ Resume/CV on LinkedIn at [linkedin.com/in/icflorescu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/), but here's the blurb:
- 20+ years of experience in web and software development
- I've worked for various companies (from mid-sized to large multinationals such as [Allianz](https://www.allianztiriac.ro/) and Garanta — [member of National Bank of Greece](https://www.nbg.gr/en/group)) during the initial part of my career; for the last part I've been working as an independent developer
- I sometimes ~~rant~~ write about technology and its impact on human behaviour in [articles like these](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/recent-activity/posts/).

## Hobbies, likes & dislikes

❤️ open-source, lazy mornings, good coffee, trekking in the mountains, reading  
👎 hypocrisy, xenophobia, willful ignorance, people talking bullshit  

## Before approaching me for work

I'm potentially interested in subcontracting front-end or full-stack development work (leaning towards front-end).  

You can learn more about what I did over the years by visiting my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/), but since you are on this page, chances are that you already have a pretty good idea of how my skills could be of assistance.  
If you want to hire me, please consider that I'm most productive with [the aforementioned tech-stack](#current-tech-stack).  

> [!NOTE]
> I'm currently getting a constant flow of approaches, some of them relevant, others not so relevant. Therefore, mentioning in your text that *you've seen my GitHub profile* would:
> - tell me that you know exactly what you need me for (as opposed to just trying to fill a vacant role);
> - let me know that my skills would indeed be valuable for you and would spare us both valuable time that we'd otherwise have to spend in trying to assess that;
> - help me **prioritize your message** and come up with a quick reply.

## How to approach me

Drop me a message at the email address listed in my GitHub profile and we'll schedule a meeting on [cal.com/icflorescu](https://cal.com/icflorescu).

[^1]: I couldn't find the time and motivation to turn [swapp.ro](https://swapp.ro/) into a real business and since the Romanian Government digital strategy related to eFactura is a major clusterf*ck, I'm thinking to (temporarily?) suspend aceepting new subscriptions.
