A full-stack developer from Bucharest, Romania, EU, with 20+ years of experience.  
Curious by nature, an avid reader of fantasy, fiction, history & tech-related literature, always looking to expand my skillset and horizons, to understand how things work and to make them work better.

Dedicating time to build and maintain great open-source projects would not be possible without your generosity.

_Side note: couldn't find the time and motivation to turn the application into a real business and since the Romanian Government digital strategy related to eFactura is a major clusterf*ck, I'm thinking to (temporarily?) suspend aceepting new subscriptions._

## Things I've worked with, back in the Dark Ages

- PHP & MySQL, around y2k (yeah, I'm that old)
- Java/J2EE, .NET/C#, Oracle, SQL Server, BizTalk, cca. 2002‚Äî2007
- CoffeeScript & IcedCofeeScript, back when when JS had no async/await
- Quite a few templating languages such as [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) or [Jade/Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and some strange old JS frameworks ([Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/), [Riot.js](https://riot.js.org/)) in the pre-React era

## Notable open-source projects I've built over the years
- üìí [Mantine DataTable](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-datatable/) ‚Äî a "dark-theme aware" table component for your Mantine UI data-rich applications, featuring asynchronous data loading support, pagination, multiple rows selection, column sorting, custom cell data rendering, row context menu, and more
- üñ±Ô∏è [Mantine ContextMenu](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-contextmenu/) ‚Äî A lightweight yet customizable context-menu for your Mantine applications, with a succinct API and dark-theme support
- ‚ú® [tRPC-SvelteKit](https://icflorescu.github.io/trpc-sveltekit) ‚Äî an adapter allowing you to build end-to-end typesafe APIs with tRPC.io in your SvelteKit applications
- ‚ú® [tRPC-Transformer](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-transformer) ‚Äî A simple tRPC transformer based on superjson with Decimal.js support
- üì¶ [PocketBaseUML](https://pocketbase-uml.github.io/) ‚Äî a free, open-source UML diagram generator for PocketBase that can be used online to connect to HTTPS servers, or runned as an `npm` package to inspect local HTTP servers
- üêß [Expose-WSL](https://github.com/icflorescu/expose-wsl) ‚Äî probably the easiest way to expose apps running on WSL to local network devices
- üåê [IISExpress-Proxy](https://github.com/icflorescu/iisexpress-proxy) ‚Äî A simple, yet practical command-line utility enabling .NET developers to test web applications served by IIS Express on remote devices; it's been around since 2015, but *I'm amazed by the sheer number of people who still have to use **IISExpress** nowadays*
- üìñ [textdiff-create](https://github.com/icflorescu/textdiff-create) and [textdiff-patch](https://github.com/icflorescu/textdiff-patch) ‚Äî simple utilities for [creating and applying lean text diffs](https://medium.com/@icflorescu/lean-diffs-for-browser-based-text-editors-46e363bc6dfe)

## The long(er) story

You can find my full-length boring ~~obituary~~ Resume/CV on LinkedIn at [linkedin.com/in/icflorescu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/), but here's the blurb:
- 20+ years of experience in web and software development
- I've worked for various companies (from mid-sized to large multinationals such as [Allianz](https://www.allianztiriac.ro/) and Garanta ‚Äî [member of National Bank of Greece](https://www.nbg.gr/en/group)) during the initial part of my career; for the last part I've been working as an independent developer
- I sometimes ~~rant~~ write about technology and its impact on human behaviour in [articles like these](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/recent-activity/posts/).

## Hobbies, likes & dislikes

‚ù§Ô∏è open-source, lazy mornings, good coffee, trekking in the mountains, reading  
üëé hypocrisy, xenophobia, willful ignorance, people talking bullshit  

## Before approaching me for work

I'm potentially interested in subcontracting front-end or full-stack development work (leaning towards front-end).  

You can learn more about what I did over the years by visiting my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/), but since you are on this page, chances are that you already have a pretty good idea of how my skills could be of assistance to you.  
If you want to hire me, please consider that I'm most productive with [the aforementioned tech-stack](#current-tech-stack).  

<ins>NOTE</ins>: I'm currently getting a constant flow of approaches, some of them relevant, others not so relevant. Therefore, mentioning in your text that *you've seen my GitHub profile* would:
- tell me that you know exactly what you need me for (as opposed to just trying to fill a vacant role);
- let me know that my skills would indeed be valuable for you and would spare us both valuable time that we'd otherwise have to spend in trying to assess that;
- help me **prioritize your message** and come up with a quick reply.

## How to approach me

Drop me a message at the email address listed in my GitHub profile so we can schedule a meeting on [cal.com/icflorescu](https://cal.com/icflorescu).
