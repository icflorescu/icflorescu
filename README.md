## Me in short

I am a web/software developer and entrepreneur with a strong focus on "making things happen" using the right technologies. Curious by nature, an avid reader of fiction, business & tech-related literature, always looking to expand my skillset and horizons, to understand how things work and to make them work better. 

## Stage I: Discovering the Internet 

I've started my web/software development career back in 1998 and for 5 years I've been working for/with various start-ups and small companies using open-source technologies that were exotic and cutting-edge by that time. 

## Stage II: Meeting the Enterprise world 

In Q2 2003 I entered the "enterprise" world of financial corporations and for the next 5 years I've been working in software development for insurance companies such as Allianz Romania and Garanta SA. While working for these companies I have been involved in a number of successful projects and exposed to a new world of challenges: using and mastering a wide set of technologies (i.e. .NET, Oracle, SQL Server Enterprise), building large system architectures, becoming a real team-player, interacting with great people with various business- and tech-backgrounds and learning as much as possible from them.

## Stage III: On my own

Following the previous experience, confident in a continuously enhanced solid knowledge-base, in 2007 I finally made the decision of starting up "on my own" in a different area of activity. Luckily for me, the timing was perfect - the real-estate bubble was booming. This, coupled with the fact that I've grown accustomed to a moderate life-style, helped me to finally break-even and gain a comfortable degree of financial independence a few years later. In plain English, I gained the privilege of being able to pick my projects and be able to work not only for money, but also for fun and challenge.

## Stage IV: The future

I have many interests, but never ceased to be a hands-on developer at heart. Imagining new system and application architectures, diving deep into countless lines of code in order to bring them to life, trying to understand how things work and striving to make them work better - these things still excite me as they used to more than 20 years ago. I find learning new programming languages and paradigms fun and stimulating, now more so than ever. Although I started my career in the Middle-Ages of IT with PHP and .NET, over the last years I've done lots of things with React/Next.js/Node.js and Typescript. 

So, if you find my skills and experience useful, don't hesitate to drop me a line and let's see where it leads us.
