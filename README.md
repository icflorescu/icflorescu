## In a nutshell

A 20+ years of experience full-stack developer from Bucharest, Romania, EU.  
Curious by nature, an avid reader of fantasy, fiction, history & tech-related literature, always looking to expand my skillset and horizons, to understand how things work and to make them work better.  
Owner of [swapp.ro](https://swapp.ro/).

## Current tech-stack

- **Typescript/JavaScript**
- **Node.js**
- **Prisma, PostgreSQL**, Hasura
- **React/Next.js** (I once dreamt I was perceiving reality in React FC calls ü§™), but I'm also **interested in Svelte/SvelteKit**
- tRPC.io (I'm also the author of [trpc-sveltekit](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-sveltekit))
- I know my way around CSS and I'm good-enough at creating website/application designs *from scratch*; see:
  - [swapp.ro](https://swapp.ro)
  - [boutiquetravel.ro](https://boutiquetravel.ro/)
  - [interiordelight](https://interiordelight.github.io/)

## Things I've worked with back in the Middle Ages

- PHP & MySQL, around y2k (yeah, I'm that old)
- Java/J2EE, .NET/C#, Oracle, SQL Server, BizTalk, cca. 2002‚Äî2007
- CoffeeScript & IcedCofeeScript, back when when JS had no async/await
- Quite a few templating languages such as [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) or [Jade/Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and some strange old JS frameworks ([Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/), [Riot.js](https://riot.js.org/)) in the pre-React era

## Some old/defunct open-source projects I've built
- [IISExpress-Proxy](https://github.com/icflorescu/iisexpress-proxy) ‚Äî this one is actually still very much alive; I'm constantly amazed by the sheer number of people who still use IISExpress  
- [ASPAX](https://aspax.github.io/) - a simple Node.js asset packager inspired by Rails, when Webpack didn't exist
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-mongodb), [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-postgresql) & [MySQL](https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-mysql) cartridges for Redhat's OpenShift, when Docker didn't exist

## The long(er) story

You can find my full-length boring ~~obituary~~ Resume/CV on LinkedIn here: [linkedin.com/in/icflorescu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/), but here's the blurb:
- 20+ years of experience in web and software development
- I've worked for various companies (from mid-sized to large multinationals such as [Allianz](https://www.allianztiriac.ro/) and Garanta‚Äî[member of National Bank of Greece](https://www.nbg.gr/en/group)) almost half of my career, the other half as an independent developer
- I sometimes ~~write~~ rant about technology and its impact on human behaviour in [articles like these](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/recent-activity/posts/).

## Hobbies, likes & dislikes

‚ù§Ô∏è open-source, lazy mornings, good coffee, trekking in the mountains  
üëé hypocrisy, xenophobia, ppl talking bullshit
